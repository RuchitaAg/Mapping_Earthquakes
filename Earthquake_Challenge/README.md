# Earthquake Data

This project shows the earthquakes data of past 7 days on different types of maps. To get the map representations, the Mapbox API is used. The maps that are used in this project are street, satellite and dark types. In the data representation, two types of data is used. In one layer all the earthquakes data are represented. In other layer, the data is represented after applying a filter to filter out the major earthquakes, which gives the high magnitude earthquakes. We can choose different layers and view the data on these different maps using the program.

## How to run the program
